This repository contains notebooks for various ArcGIS workflows. A summary of each notebook is provided below.

### Clone Items Notebook App

This [ArcGIS Notebook app](https://github.com/tyhranac/ArcGIS-Notebooks/blob/main/CloneItemsNotebookApp.ipynb) can be used to clone content -- like hosted feature layers, web maps, and web apps -- between portals/organizations. It combines this [ArcGIS Developer's documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/cloning-content/) on cloning items with this [iPython widgets tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abXuRM0QVD0) to make the ArcGIS API for Python's clone content functionality more accessible to non-Python users.

### Programmatically Deleting Content in ArcGIS Online

This [ArcGIS Notebook](https://github.com/tyhranac/ArcGIS-Notebooks/blob/main/DeleteContent.ipynb) can be used to programatically delete content in ArcGIS Online/Portal for ArcGIS. It uses conditional logic to handle delete protection and recursion to handle dependent items.

### Check the Authoring Apps of Web Maps

This [ArcGIS Notebook](https://github.com/tyhranac/ArcGIS-Notebooks/blob/main/CheckAuthoringApp.ipynb) can be used to check the authoring apps of your ArcGIS Online web maps (e.g. was a web map created by/last saved in Map Viewer? Map Viewer Classic? ArcGIS Survey123 Connect? ArcGIS Workforce?).
