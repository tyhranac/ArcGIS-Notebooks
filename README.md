This repository contains notebooks for various ArcGIS workflows. A summary of each notebook is provided below.

### Clone Items Notebook App

This [ArcGIS Notebook app](https://github.com/tyhranac/ArcGIS-Notebooks/blob/main/CloneItemsNotebookApp.ipynb) can be used to clone content -- like hosted feature layers, web maps, and web apps -- between portals/organizations. It combines this [ArcGIS Developer's documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/cloning-content/) on cloning items with this [iPython widgets tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abXuRM0QVD0) to make the ArcGIS API for Python's clone content functionality more accessible to non-Python users.
